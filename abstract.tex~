In this work we introduce a method and descriptor for object context in full 3D pointclouds of places.
Among various applications for this we are suggesting it to be used for place classification and semantic mapping.
This work is unique regarding its use of full 3D pointcloud of scenes and also introducing this descriptor to be used to 
represent places.
