In this work we introduce a descriptor for object context in full 3D pointclouds of places and a method to extract 
features and build the context model.
Among various applications for this we are suggesting it to be used for place categorization and semantic mapping.
This work is unique regarding its use of full 3D pointcloud of scenes and also introducing this descriptor to be used to 
represent places.
