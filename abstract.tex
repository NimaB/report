Contextual information is helpful for object detection and object based place representation. 
3D data significantly helps capturing geometrical information about scenes.
In this work, a feature descriptor  for object context in full 3D pointclouds of places is introduced together with a 
method to extract features and build the context model.
The proposed model is evaluated in experiments on pointclouds from different types of places which include different object 
categories.
Results shows the promising ability of the model to predict possible context of objects in pointclouds or complete 3D maps of 
an environment. 
Among various applications for this, the author suggests object context models to be used in place categorization and semantic
mapping and discusses a method for it.
To the knowledge of the author, this work is unique regarding its use of full 3D pointcloud of scenes and also introducing 
this descriptor to be used to represent places.
